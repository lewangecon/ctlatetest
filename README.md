This repository contains the functions to replicate the simulation results in "Instrument Validity Tests with Causal Trees: With an Application to the Same-sex Instrument", Raphael Guber (2018), available as MEA Discussion Paper 1872 at http://www.mea.mpisoc.mpg.de/uploads/user_mea_discussionpapers/1872_MEA_DP_05_2018.pdf

The testing procedure is based on Athey and Imbens (2016, PNAS) Causal Tree algorithm, which can be obtained from Susan Athey's Github page https://github.com/susanathey/causalTree
